description: 'Software Engineering - Project API Structuring (.NET 9). Explain the whole process of building a project API from nothing with .Net 9. I want the way of creating the most secure possible API, even if this means it will be overcomplicated. Add resources outside of the .NET framework if needed and use as many of the .NET capabilities as needed. Don't teach me, just build the project step by step explaining what you are doing and why. Use best practices. The project should have at least 5 layers (e.g. API, Application, Domain, Infrastructure, etc). Explain how to configure the project for Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control. Explain how to configure the project for Unit Testing and Integration Testing. Explain how to configure the project for secure authentication and authorization (e.g. JWT, OAuth2, etc). Explain how to configure the project for logging and monitoring. Explain how to configure the project for error handling and validation. Explain how to configure the project for database access (e.g. Entity Framework Core, Dapper, etc). Explain how to configure the project for API documentation (e.g. Swagger, OpenAPI, etc). Explain how to configure the project for CI/CD (e.g. GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, etc).'
